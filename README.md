## Guide

This is a basic calculator able to perform a single operation with 2 values at a time. To work with negative numbers, click the subtraction button, input a number, and press the equal sign to get a negative value.


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser (I did not do this)

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JS
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla HTML

### What I learned

When creating the scripts for toggling theme changes, I spent an hour trying to figure out why the second theme was not working despite the code being logically correct. I then opened the inspection tool using chrome, and realized there was a typo in the code. As for what this taught me, it was to use the inspection tool as soon as I see a problem in order to solve it more quickly.


### Continued development

This project was made entirely using vanilla Javascript. Many areas of the code, particularly in the file for the theme toggling scripts, could have been much shorter had I waited until I learned how to use jQuery and React.js. I might revisit the code for this project at a later date and compare how it could be more efficient had I used those tools, and also how the calculator could have been coded to do more complex operations while keeping the code efficient.
